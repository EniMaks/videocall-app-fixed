# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WebRTC TURN Server Configuration (Optional, but Recommended for Production)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For reliable video calls across different networks, a TURN server is needed
# to relay media when a direct peer-to-peer connection fails.
#
# For development, you can use a free TURN server like the one from
# OpenRelay (https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/).
#
# For production, it is STRONGLY recommended to set up and use your own
# Coturn server for privacy, stability, and performance.
#
# For local development with the included Coturn server:
# VITE_TURN_URL=turn:127.0.0.1:3478
# VITE_TURN_USERNAME=turnuser
# VITE_TURN_CREDENTIAL=supersecretturnpassword
#
# VITE_TURN_URL=turn:your-turn-server.com:3478
# VITE_TURN_USERNAME=your-username
# VITE_TURN_CREDENTIAL=your-password
